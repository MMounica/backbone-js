Managing the Data
The most important thing in our small project is the data. Our tasks are what we should manage, so let's start from there. Here is our model definition.


// models/ToDo.js
app.models.ToDo = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        title: "ToDo",
        archived: false,
        done: false
    }
});
