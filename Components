Components :
We have a namespace, so now we can start creating components. Here is how the main menu looks:

// views/menu.js
app.views.menu = Backbone.View.extend({
    initialize: function() {},
    render: function() {}
});
We created a property called menu which holds the class of the navigation. Later, we may add a method in the factory module which creates an instance of it.


var ViewsFactory = {
    menu: function() {
        if(!this.menuView) {
            this.menuView = new api.views.menu({ 
                el: $("#menu")
            });
        }
        return this.menuView;
    }
};
