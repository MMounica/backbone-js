Setup
Here is the file structure which we'll use:

css
    +-- styles.css
js
    +-- collections
        +-- ToDos.js
    +-- models
        +-- ToDo.js
    +-- vendor
       +-- backbone.js
       +-- jquery-1.10.2.min.js
       +-- underscore.js
    +-- views
    +-- App.js
 +-- index.html


Flow
The entry point of the app is App.js and its init method. This is what we will call in the onload handler of the window object.


window.onload = function() {
    app.init();
}
Showing Our First View (Main Navigation)
The first thing which we have to show, is the main application's navigation.


// views/menu.js
app.views.menu = Backbone.View.extend({
    template: _.template($("#tpl-menu").html()),
    initialize: function() {
        this.render();
    },
    render: function(){
        this.$el.html(this.template({}));
    }
});
It's only nine lines of code, but lots of cool things are happening here. The first one is setting a template. If you remember, we added Underscore.js to our app? We are going to use its templating engine, because it works good and it is simple enough to use.

_.template(templateString, [data], [settings])
